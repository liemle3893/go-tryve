# Directory Contract & State Layout

Reference loaded on-demand by `autoflow-deliver/SKILL.md`.

## Two-Root Contract

Subagents inherit no cwd assumptions. The orchestrator resolves and passes these two absolute paths to every `autoflow-*` dispatch after Step 2:

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)                # main repo
WORKTREE_DIR=$(cd ../<repo>-<ticket-key> && pwd)          # feature worktree
```

### Why the split matters

| Location | Contains | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| `REPO_ROOT/.planning/ticket/<KEY>/` | Task brief, state files, feedback ledger, progress file | Must survive worktree create/remove; readable by orchestrator between dispatches |
| `WORKTREE_DIR/src/`, `WORKTREE_DIR/tests/e2e/` | Source code and test files on the feature branch | REPO_ROOT is on the base branch — writing source there corrupts the wrong tree |

### Command routing

- `git diff origin/${BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD` — MUST run from `WORKTREE_DIR` (diffs the wrong branch from REPO_ROOT)
- `tryve autoflow loop-state` — MUST run from `REPO_ROOT` (finds state files in `.planning/ticket/<KEY>/state/`)
- `BASE_BRANCH` — read from `.autoflow/bootstrap.json`

### Step 1 exception

`autoflow-jira-fetcher` runs BEFORE the worktree exists. It receives only `REPO_ROOT`.

## State Directory Layout

Per-ticket artifacts live under `.planning/ticket/<TICKET-KEY>/`:

```

    +-- REVIEW-FIX.md                   # Step 9: code fixer report
```

All state is written under `.planning/ticket/<KEY>/state/` by the `tryve autoflow deliver` subcommands. Paths are the same whether the workflow runs from REPO_ROOT or the worktree.
